Modules:
	2x2 Frame [Req: Screen->DrawFrame()]
	Counter Block?
	Line
	Rectangle
	Desc Box (Selected Item Name, but not only items will be selectable...)
	Desc Object (An object with pos and such like selectable items,
		but lets you use a message string as the description, and does nothing else)
	Text
	Text Box
	Interact Object (An object with pos and such, but when you press 'A' on it, it triggers a customizable script function to run)
		[Req: Abstract Functions]
	Page Swap Object (See 'Pages' under 'Systems' todo)

Triforce Frame/Pieces are covered by tile blocks, and LI_ conditionals.

Systems:
	Text storage system, allowing storing script strings. This requires a new file type ('.tsub', for 'text subscreen'?)
		This would allow storing 419 strings of length 512 (including nullchar). These could be referenced by text/textbox/desc objects.
		The storage would be *global* among all subscreens, rather than per-subscreen, thus the new storage.
		The storage also needs to be added to the joint 'project' file type.
		(419 of length 512 as 214748/512 = 419.429688)
	Pages: L/R (by option) swap pages, or a 'Page Swap' module, which on 'A' press swaps to a 'target page'
		(possibly with a given 'transition' style). This allows much more subscreen space than just the 256x224 area of the screen,
		instead allowing multiple screens, up to a likely 256 max.
		Should also allow pages (in a 'page options'?) to be ignored when L/R'ing; or have L/R be triggered by a 'Page Swap' module to
		it's destination? This allows pages that cannot be L/R'd to, which could be accessible as 'sub-menus'; think Bomber's Notebook in MM,
		or Kinstone List in MC.
